This is a repo watcher for mangos ext system.  It is used to download ext's
that have been made by the community or IAS.

pretty simple to use.  Just launch it and follow the instructions.  

You can still remove the ext with the mango command 

./ma.sh remove-ext extRepo

just like you would with any other EXT
